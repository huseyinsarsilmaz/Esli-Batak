This repo is semi-complete, all the rules of the game have implemented but it still requires some improvements
- The buttons in the Score Table needs to be better
- Cpu's bidding algorithm need to better, cpu extremely rarely bids.
- Cpu's playing algorithm is designed to lose, it needs to be designed to win
- Messagboxes needs to be removed and their functions needs to be implemented with components.
